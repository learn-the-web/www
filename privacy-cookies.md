## Definitions

We’re going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read. When we say “site” or “website”, we mean [learntheweb.courses](https://learntheweb.courses/) and the services offered through that site. When we say “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Learn the Web (Thomas J Bradley), an Ontario business.

## Stored data

The location and information we store differs based on whether or not you have a Progressinator account.

### With a Progressinator account

We store, within our databases, located in the [Eastern US on Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/) machines, [personal information](#progressinator--personal-information) as well as progress through the courses.

Each assessment (videos, exercises, activities, etc.) stores the following information—**and associates it with your user account:**

- The date the assessment was submitted;
- Who or what submitted the assessment, Markbot or your teacher;
- The grade you received on your assessment, as a percentage;
- Whether or not the automated cheat detection systems were triggered;
- Extra details pertaining to the specific assessment, e.g. completion time, teacher comments, number of commits, number of correct answers, etc.

On your computer _only_, we store:

- The topic pages you’ve visited,
- Whether to load the custom web fonts or not,
- Cached versions of the assignments loaded from GitHub.

_Clearing your local & session storage will completely remove this local information._

### Without a Progressinator account

We store information _on your computer_ to track your progress, e.g. remember which pages you visited. _This information isn’t transmitted or stored on a server—it’s only available on your own machine._

On your computer _only_, we store:

- The topic pages you’ve visited,
- The statistics on how much you’ve watched the video playlists,
- Whether to load the custom web fonts or not,
- Cached versions of the assignments loaded from GitHub.

_Clearing your local & session storage will completely remove this local information._

## Markbot

The desktop Markbot application stores the following personal information:

- Your GitHub username
- A unique API token assigned to you by the Progressinator application

_These two pieces of information are sent to the Progressinator application, only over encrypted HTTPS, to record your assessment progress._ Markbot also sends other ancillary information, e.g. completion time, number of commits, automated cheat detection, etc. with every grade submission.

**These pieces of information must be sent by Markbot to facilitate application functionality.**
